   _Variable assignment_ Here we create a variable called x and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator
            
      x = 0
   _Function calls_ print() is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or arguments) to the function in those parentheses
   
      print(x)
   The colon (:) at the end of the if line indicates that a new "code block" is starting. Subsequent lines which are indented are part of that code block. Some other languages use {curly braces} to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks
   
    x=0
    print(x)

    x = x + 4

    if x > 0:
       print("Number is greater than 0")
    
    z = "Hello " * x
    print(z)  
                
Numbers and arithmetic in python
* type() is the second built-in function we've seen (after print()), and it's another good one to remember. It's very useful to be able to ask Python "what kind of thing is this?"

* A natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We've seen the + operator for addition, and the * operator for multiplication (of a sort). Python also has us covered for the rest of the basic buttons on your calculator:

      Operator	      Name	               Description
      a + b	         Addition	            Sum of a and b
      a - b	         Subtraction	         Difference of a and b
      a * b	         Multiplication	      Product of a and b
      a / b	         True division	      Quotient of a and b
      a // b	      Floor division	      Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts
      a % b	         Modulus	            Integer remainder after division of a by b
      a ** b	      Exponentiation	      a raised to the power of b
      -a	            Negation	            The negative of a
