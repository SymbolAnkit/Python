Introduction on Python Programming

   _Variable assignment_ Here we create a variable called x and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator
            
      x = 0
   _Function calls_ print() is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or arguments) to the function in those parentheses
   
      print(x)
   The colon (:) at the end of the if line indicates that a new "code block" is starting. Subsequent lines which are indented are part of that code block. Some other languages use {curly braces} to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks
   
    x=0
    print(x)

    x = x + 4

    if x > 0:
       print("Number is greater than 0")
    
    z = "Hello " * x
    print(z)
